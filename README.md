Zodiac Code

This project makes the following basic assumptions: 
* All symbols only translate to one letter. 
* Multiple symbols can have the same letter value.
* The Zodiac ciphers contain errors, either intentionally or not. 
* The method used to encipher all of his messages is homophonic simple substitution.
